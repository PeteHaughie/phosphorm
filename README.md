## On What You Need To Get Set Up

Phosphorm can and will run without any kind of external DAC

But it is optimized to work with the hifiberry dac plus, if u run this version with anything else you will probably have issues unless u do a bit of reconfiguration!

And as always the simpler way to do things is just download, uncompress and use balena etcher to write one of these images to an sd card!

Please note that if you are using the no DAC version you will not be able to use HDMI output at this moment

Sorry no manual rn!  Just try messing around with the kontrols tho and you'll see some cool stuffs.  The bottom 5 buttons on the bottom left hand side switch from different scales.
The default is 5et, then from left to right we have 7ET, 12ET, carlos alpha, carlos beta, and no scale at all.

Heres a real loosey goosey intro to what exactly is going on with the controls!
